  Disk Copy:
    ☐ Copy disk to disk fails when no disk is inserted initialy. Need return code from intial copy to decide if wait for disk or exit.
    ☐ Copy disk to ADF needs to support creating a dir and auto naming (ADF00001.ADF) find highest and inc 1.
  Directory:
    ☐ Seems to crash if you enter a sub dir containing files, go back up, enter empty sub dir, move up and down, go back and crashes
    ☐ Add long file name support
      - use text bounds to clip extra long filename before volumename?
      - Or show long filname across entire line and have bottom row for volume name <- better?
    ☐ Test with a huge number of files in a directory, it will need to be paged ... eeek
  Refactor:
    ☐ Reduce memory footprint
      ☐ Only create ADFx when needed, move the creation and deletion of them into the commands
      ☐ Enclose all strings with F() to free memory
      - new
