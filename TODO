  Disk Copy:
    ☐ Copy disk to ADF needs to support creating a dir and auto naming (ADF00001.ADF) find highest and inc 1.
    ✔ Fix disk copy functions so they correctly display the xcopy logo @done(19-03-10 12:14)
    ✔ Display error messages in red text @done(19-03-10 12:14)
    ✔ Copy disk to disk fails when no disk is inserted initialy. Need return code from intial copy to decide if wait for disk or exit. @done(19-03-10 12:13)
    ✔ Allow interrupt exit during track retries @done(19-03-09 12:41)
  SDCard:
    ☐ ADF needs correct creation date on file
    ✔ Move to SDFat library @done(19-03-08 14:22)
    ✔ Add long file name support @done(19-03-08 14:22)
      - use text bounds to clip extra long filename before volumename?
      - Or show long filname across entire line and have bottom row for volume name <- better?
  Directory:
    ☐ Audio fires more than once when scrolled past MAXSCREENITEMS
    ☐ Seems to crash if you enter a sub dir containing files, go back up, enter empty sub dir, move up and down, go back and crashes
    ☐ Test with a huge number of files in a directory, it will need to be paged ... eeek
    ✔ Add thumbnails to flash directory entries @done(19-03-08 22:18)
      ✔ Check for file on sd instead of serialflash @done(19-03-09 01:02)
  Graphics:
    ✔ Convert BMP's to RAW 565 and draw directly using push commands for faster fullscreen updates @done(19-03-09 14:29)
    ✔ Change SerialFlash thumb nails to use this (180+ms down to 70ms) @done(19-03-09 14:29)
    ☐ Fix lost sound after rawDraw
      ✔ Temp fix tostop rawDraw / colorPush while audio playing. @done(19-03-09 22:41)
      ✔ Convert rest of app over to rawDraw once fixed @done(19-03-09 22:41)
      ☐ Investigate actual root cause
  Refactor:
    ☐ Move the modified SDFat library into local library
      ✔ Altered iostream.h to fix "'ostream& endl(ostream&)' redeclared as different kind of symbol" @done(19-03-08 22:22)
      ✔ (https://github.com/greiman/SdFat/issues/60) @done(19-03-08 22:22)
    ☐ Reduce memory footprint
      ☐ Only create ADFx when needed, move the creation and deletion of them into the commands
      ☐ Enclose all strings with F() to free memory
