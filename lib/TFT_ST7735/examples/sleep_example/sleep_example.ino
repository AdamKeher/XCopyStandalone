/*
Sleep Command example
Very simple, when sleep on DC/DC converter is stopped, Internal oscillator is stopped, and panel scanning is stopped
In Idle mode the background goes white, this because the internal mosfet are shorted to VGL, I tried to find a way to avoid this but no joy.
MCU interface and memory are still working and the memory keeps its contents.
NOTE:
The led background still active since it's NOT controlled by chip so you have to use useBacklight!
To do this, you need a small circuit (a transistor and 2 resistor) as seen in my wiki connected to backlight led.
